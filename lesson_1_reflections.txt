How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    this helped me in finding the difference between two fles using terminal 
    this is a better and effective way to find the difference in large files 
    this is very effective for programm development.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    this saves time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    cons-we will have to decide when to commit.
    pros-gives us the flexibility

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving in one comint makes it more accesible for programmers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" help us see the details of the commits that were made in the repository;
	"git diff"- let us find the difference between the two commits
	"git config --global color.ui auto"- command is used to get the colorfull output of the git diff  		command. This makes the output more understandable. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    at any instant of time i can go back and do everything as it was earlier. this feeling lets me experiment 		completely with what i want to do in my projects without the fear of loosing something which i have 		already achived in  my project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    google summer of code preparation.
